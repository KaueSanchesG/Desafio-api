This project was a challenge from my college to improve our knowledge about annotations and how they work with databases.

## Status ✅

This project has been completed as it was used at my college to learn more about database and Spring Boot applications.

## How to use 📋

First of all, you'll need a Java IDE and a database to run this project. I'm using **[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** as the IDE and **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** as the database (you'll need to open pgAdmin4 and create a database called "desafio" and a schema called "desafio_api" inside the "desafio" database).

Next, follow this code sequence in your local directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KaueSanchesG/Desafio-api.git

# Open the IDE by typing
idea
After that, navigate to the directory where you've cloned the project and open it.
```

To run the project, open **src/java/com.example.desafioapi/DesafioApiApplication.java** file and click the run button or use the shortcut Shift+F10.
